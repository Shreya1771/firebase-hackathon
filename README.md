# Firebase hackathon
An entry for the hackathon

# Inspiration
Forms aren't traditionally known for being friendly and approachable. Many forms are often steeped in legal jargon and halting cautionary statements. The advantage of a digital form is the opportunity to break information into manageable, bite-size chunks that can be more friendly. And more human.

# What it does
My form is a basic multi-view Angular application. It captures user inputs in an object and stores it in Firebase.

# Challenges I ran into
The code for the multi-view form becomes tricky after several steps are added. I used Lucidchart to map out and visualize the flow of the form before I started building.

Storing data to be CSV readable was also new and challenging. All CSV data needs to be organized well and captured in a format that allows for research and study. For example, the exported information should not list an adult as "false" for being a student. Instead, it should be empty, so that the column can be compiled to show correct percentages of student demographics. By making sure these fields are left blank for adults when exporting, the compiled information in a CSV will be more accurate.

# User Testing
I began user testing the moment I completed the flow of the form, with a total of 13 people. I would hand my participants a piece of paper with fake information to use as they filled out the application. I wanted to simulate two scenarios:

Distracting participants from the form by having them search for information outside of the application.
Simulating an adult who may not remember exact social security numbers, income, etc.
I also did a couple of rounds of testing on UserTesting.com. Tests frequently revealed issues with broken functionality and incorrect input types. More than anything, the user testing was beneficial to alter some of the language and messaging that was confusing to participants, as I mention in the video.
